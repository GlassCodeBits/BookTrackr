# Copy of Submission Guidelines for Project on Canvas

## Define Requirements: [10% of the Project]

List a few core features or functional requirements your project should meet.

> Example: For a library management system, some requirements might include adding new books, issuing books to users, and tracking due dates.

## Create a Class Diagram: [10% of the Project]

Design a UML class diagram that outlines the structure of your project. This should include:

* Key classes in your project
* Relationships between these classes (e.g., inheritance, associations)
* Key methods and attributes for each class

## Develop the Project: [70% of the Project]

Write the Java code for your project. Ensure that it follows good coding practices, and try to include object-oriented programming concepts.

## Write Test Cases: [10% of the Project]

Provide a few test cases that demonstrate how the functionality of your project works. Each test case should include:

* Input data
* Expected output
* Actual output once you run the program

Use the following format to document your test cases:

| Test Case ID | Test Case Description | Input | Expected Output | Actual Output | Status (Pass/Fail) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC1 | Add valid student and grades | Student Name: John, Grades: [85, 90, 78] | Student John added with grades [85, 90, 78] | Student John added with grades [85, 90, 78] | Pass |
| TC2 | Calculate average grade | Student Name: John | Average grade: 84.33 | Average grade: 84.33 | Pass |
| TC3 | Determine letter grade (A) | Average Grade: 92 | Letter Grade: A | Letter Grade: A | Pass |
| TC4 | Add invalid grade (negative value) | Student Name: Sarah, Grades: [85, -5, 78] | Error: Invalid grade | Error: Invalid grade | Pass |
| TC5
